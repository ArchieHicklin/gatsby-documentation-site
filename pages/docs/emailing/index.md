Mailroom uses Google Sheets and the Google Email API to check and send emails.

You will need to set up a Google Sheet in this format:

| John | john@techmag.com | Tech Mag |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------- |

**Example sheet:**

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144IU4iw3-g0pX7l_hpbobXf-KWyRSYlHZiQfWDTceUg/edit?usp=sharing) for an example sheet.

**Full guide:**

[**Please download and read the guide before sending emails.**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xkl92wlxuh64yl/MailroomGuide.pdf?dl=1)

**Issues when sending:**

We are currently waiting for Google to review our app, so when you log in with your email for the first time you will have to click Advanced > and trust mailroom.press to send emails.

We do not, and cannot save any of your data when using the emailing function. If you have any concerns please feel free to reach out to us or review our [privacy policy](https://www.mailroom.press/privacy).

**Using non-Gmail accounts**

Accounts such as joe@company.com may be used as long as they are linked to Google Apps. [This takes around 30 minutes to set up](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/how-to-set-up-google-mail-across-a-small-company-joe-moreno/).
