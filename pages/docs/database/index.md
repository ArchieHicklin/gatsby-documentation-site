**Browsing the database**

Once you've logged in you will be taken to the Mailroom database. This is a database of business email addresses of journalists. You can navigate this database by using the arrows at the bottom.

**Filtering**

You can filer the database by using the filter tabs at the top. These are currently "Name", "Last Name", "Position", and "Publication".

**Searching**

You can search the database by using the search bar at the top.

**Exporting**

You can export the database to a CSV using the download button located at the bottom of the database screen.

**The database is slow to load**

We are currently using a CSV in the application to load journalists. This allows for us to add, remove and verify the authenticity of the emails we include in the Mailroom app. In the future as we add more verified emails, it may become slow to load initially, however it also gives you full control over exporting journalists and the ability to collate and search offline.
