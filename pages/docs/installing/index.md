**If you pre-ordered**

To install Mailroom, head to [the registration page](https://www.mailroom.press/pre-order) and register using the email you used to pay for Mailroom. Once you’ve registered you will be taken to a page where you can download Mailroom for macOS, Windows, or Linux. Install the app to your local machine.

**If you are a new customer**

If you haven’t pre-paid, Mailroom is currently unavailable and will be launching to the wider public within the next two weeks.
