**Google Sheets**

Mailroom uses Google Sheets and the Google Email API to check and send emails, this makes it easier to send, manage and share your work.

If you do not have a Google account please make one to experience the full features of Mailroom.

Mailroom includes a Google Sheets tab inside the app to make your workflow easier when copying contacts from the database to your email list.

For your sheet, please use the same email account as you use to send your mail.

**Using non-Gmail accounts**

Accounts such as joe@company.com may be used as long as they are linked to Google Apps. [This takes around 30 minutes to set up](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/how-to-set-up-google-mail-across-a-small-company-joe-moreno/).
